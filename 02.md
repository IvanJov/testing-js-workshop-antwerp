# Introduction to TDD

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests, only. This is opposed to software development that allows software to be added that is not proven to meet requirements. The goal of this challenge is to learn what TDD is why should you use it.

## Problem

Using the same method from the first test, write a test for checking if a method is returning a factorial of the given number. Then write a method that will make your test pass.

First, write the method using the imperative programing (just statements). Make tests pass. Then rewrite the method to use the recursion. Make sure that your tests are still green.

```js
const factorial = n => {
  if (n < 0) {
    return 'error'
  }

  if (n === 0) {
    return 1
  }

  return n * factorial(n - 1)
}
```

# Mocha and Sinon

[Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) is a library for test spies, stubs and mocks. Let's learn how to use it with Mocha.

## Problem

Write a method that generates random integer between 0 and 100. Then use that method in the sum method that we already created. Write a test for both methods.

<details>
  <summary>Sum method</summary>

```js
const getRandomInt = () => Math.floor(Math.random() * 100)

const sumRandomNumbers = () => {
  return getRandomInt() + getRandomInt()
}
```

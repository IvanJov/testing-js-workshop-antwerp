# Nock

[Nock](https://github.com/nock/nock) is an HTTP server mocking and expectations library for Node.js.

Nock can be used to test modules that perform HTTP requests in isolation.

For instance, if a module performs HTTP requests to a CouchDB server or makes HTTP requests to the Amazon API, you can test that module in isolation.

## Problem

Add tests to the Hackernews class that tests class in the isolation, by mocking the URLs that class is calling.

# Introduction to Jest

[Jest](http://jestjs.io/) is a testing framework developed by Facebook. It's one of the fastest and the most advanced tools. Goal of this challenge is to learn more about Jest and write couple tests in it.

## Problem

Write tests for the `sum` and `factorial` methods that we already wrote.

<details>
  <summary>Sum and Factorial methods</summary>

```js
const sum = (a, b) => {
  return a + b
}

const factorial = n => {
  if (n < 0) {
    return 'error'
  }

  if (n === 0) {
    return 1
  }

  return n * factorial(n - 1)
}
```

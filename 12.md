# Mocking with Jest

[Jest](http://jestjs.io/) introduced a wonderful support for mocking methods. That's already coming with Jest, you don't need to install or include anything. More about mocking: http://jestjs.io/docs/en/manual-mocks

Goal of this challenge is to learn how to mock methods with Jest and test them. 

## Problem

Write a method that reads a number from the file, generates a random number between 0 and the number read from the file, and writes that random number to a file. Test the method using Jest mocking functionality.

```js
const fs = require('fs')

const randomNumber = () => {
  const numberFromAFile = fs.readFileSync('./file.txt')

  const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * (Number(numberFromAFile) + 1))

  fs.writeFileSync('./file.txt', randomNumber)

  console.log(randomNumber)
}
```

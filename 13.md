# Jest snapshot testing

[Jest](http://jestjs.io/) is the first testing framework that introduced Snapshot testing. Snapshot tests are a very useful tool whenever you want to make sure your UI does not change unexpectedly. A typical snapshot test case for a mobile app renders a UI component, takes a screenshot, then compares it to a reference image stored alongside the test. The test will fail if the two images do not match: either the change is unexpected, or the screenshot needs to be updated to the new version of the UI component. Snapshot can also be any data that you have, some array, or object, or string, anything that can be compared.
